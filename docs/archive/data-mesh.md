# Data Mesh

## Introduction
Data Mesh is an innovative approach to data architecture and data platform thinking, introduced by Zhamak Dehghani, a technology consultant and thought leader at ThoughtWorks. This concept addresses the challenges faced by large-scale, complex, and rapidly evolving modern organizations, shifting the focus from centralized, monolithic data platforms to a more distributed, domain-oriented, and decentralized model.
## Concepts
The key principles of Data Mesh are:
### Domain Ownership
This principle requires domain teams to take responsibility for their own data, aligning analytical data composition with domain boundaries and system bounded contexts. This approach moves analytical and operational data ownership from a central data team to the domain teams themselves.
### Data as a Product
Data Mesh promotes a product thinking philosophy for analytical data, treating domain data as if it were a public API. Domain teams are responsible for providing high-quality data to satisfy the needs of other domains, recognizing that there are data consumers beyond their own domain.
### Self-Serve Data Infrastructure
Embracing platform thinking for data infrastructure, Data Mesh encourages the creation of a self-serve data infrastructure platform. A dedicated data platform team provides domain-agnostic tools, functionality, and systems to build, execute, and maintain interoperable data products for all domains. This platform empowers domain teams to create and consume data products seamlessly.
### Federated Governance
This principle ensures the interoperability of all data products through standardization. Data Mesh fosters organization-wide adherence to this standardization, creating a data ecosystem that complies with organizational rules and industry regulations.
## Wrap up
By focusing on these four key principles, Data Mesh revolutionizes data management and enables organizations to excel in today's rapidly evolving data landscape.
