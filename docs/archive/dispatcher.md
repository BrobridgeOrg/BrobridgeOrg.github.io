The Dispatcher is a core component of Gravity, responsible for managing the mechanisms of Data Product processing. It is capable of managing structured Schemas, Rules, and the Tokens required for Federated Governance. In more detail, the Dispatcher classifies Raw Data Products, assigns Events to their respective Domains, and utilizes a partitioning mechanism to enhance the scalability of the Data Mesh.
