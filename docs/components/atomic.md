# Atomic
Atomic, serving as a logical processing unit for data, bears the responsibility of driving data operations and business logic. Regardless of whether database synchronization mechanisms like Change Data Capture (CDC) are employed, Atomic acts as a pivotal hub for inter-system connections, playing an indispensable role. 

For this, we will provide comprehensive functions and mechanisms to interface with various existing systems, enabling users to rapidly construct modern data processing workflows. Moreover, by leveraging a container architecture, we are able to implement data grid systems with quicker deployment and enhanced scalability.
